# mixed_messages

 #**Portfolio project 1 codecademy**

In this project I am aiming to create a random message outputter. The angle I am going for is to recreate the lessonalyzer from the show solar opposites.

##Steps to accomplish this goal.
1. I must create a list.
    - The list I will be using the the already existing list from the lessonalyzer. 
2. I have to produce 3 random pieces of data of a message for each output. For example, if you lost in monopoly(instance), the sun goddess says(person), "don't run with scissors (lesson)".
